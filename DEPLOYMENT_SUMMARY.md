## 🎯 How It Works

### For Users:

1. **Creating Events**:
   - Click "+ Suggest Event" button
   - If limit reached → Alert + Stats modal opens
   - If cooldown active → Alert shows wait time

2. **Viewing Stats**:
   - Click 📊 button in header anytime
   - See monthly progress bar
   - Check how many events remaining
   - View total lifetime events

3. **Monthly Reset**:
   - Automatic on 1st of each month
   - Fresh 10-event allowance
   - Cooldown timer also resets

### Technical Flow:

```
User clicks "Suggest Event"
    ↓
canCreateEvent() checks:
  - Monthly count < 10? ✓
  - Last event > 5 mins ago? ✓
    ↓
  YES → Open modal, allow creation
    ↓
  After creation → recordEventCreation()
    ↓
  Update cookie with new stats
```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Rate Limiting:

1. **Create 9 events** (should work fine)
2. **Create 10th event** (should work, but it's the last)
3. **Try 11th event** → Should show:
   ```
   Alert: "You've reached the limit of 10 events per month. Resets on the 1st."
   Stats modal opens automatically
   ```

### Test Cooldown:

1. **Create an event**
2. **Immediately try another** → Should show:
   ```
   Alert: "Please wait 5 minutes before creating another event."
   ```
3. **Wait 5 minutes** → Should work

### Test Stats Modal:

1. **Click 📊 button**
2. **Verify displays**:
   - Current month count
   - Progress bar
   - Lifetime total
   - Last event date
   - Reset countdown

```
