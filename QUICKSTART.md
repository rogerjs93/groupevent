## 🚀 Your App is Running!

**Development Server**: http://localhost:5174/eventorganizer/

The app is currently running in development mode. You can now:
1. View the app in your browser
2. Suggest events
3. Vote on events
4. Set a username
5. See time slot preferences

## 📋 Next Steps

### 1. Set Up GitHub Integration (Required for full functionality)

The app uses GitHub as a backend. Follow these steps:

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   
   # Create repo on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/eventorganizer.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Create Personal Access Token**
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Generate new token (classic)
   - Select scope: `repo`
   - Copy the token

3. **Configure Environment**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Add your token to `.env.local`:
     ```
     VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
     ```

4. **Update Configuration**
   - Edit `src/utils/github.ts`
   - Change `GITHUB_OWNER` to your GitHub username
   - Change `GITHUB_REPO` to your repository name

5. **Create Data Files in GitHub**
   - Create `data/events.json` with content: `[]`
   - Create `data/users.json` with content: `[]`

📖 **Detailed instructions in `SETUP.md`**

### 2. Customize Turku Events Integration (Optional)

Update `src/utils/turkuApi.ts` to connect to real event APIs:
- Turku.fi events API
- VisitFinland API
- Custom data sources

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

```bash
# After pushing to GitHub:
npm run deploy
```

Your app will be live at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/eventorganizer/`

## 🛠️ Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server (already running!)
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run deploy   # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

## 🎨 Customization Ideas

1. **Styling**: Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change colors
2. **Time Slots**: Modify options in `SuggestEvent.tsx`
3. **Event Fields**: Add categories, dates, images
4. **Features**: Add comments, event sharing, notifications

## 🔐 Important Security Notes

- ❗ Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- ❗ For production, use GitHub Secrets for the token
- ❗ Data in public repos is visible to everyone

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Port already in use
Your app automatically uses port 5174 since 5173 was busy. This is normal.

### GitHub API errors
Make sure:
- Token has `repo` scope
- Data files exist in repository
- `GITHUB_OWNER` and `GITHUB_REPO` are correct

### Build errors
Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed.
